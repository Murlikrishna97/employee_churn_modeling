    "\n",
    "# An **epoch** means training your model on the entire dataset exactly once. \n",
    "\n",
    "# **Simple explanation:**\n",
    "# - Imagine you have a textbook with 1000 pages\n",
    "# - Reading the entire book once = 1 epoch\n",
    "# - Reading it again from start to finish = another epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "# In your code, `epochs=100` means:\n",
    "# - The model will process all your training data up to 100 times\n",
    "# - Each time through the data, the model learns and adjusts its weights\n",
    "# - It's like giving your model multiple chances to study the same material\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Why 100 Epochs?\n",
    "\n",
    "# The number 100 is just a maximum limit, not a requirement. It means:\n",
    "# - \"Keep training for up to 100 complete passes through the data\"\n",
    "# - The early stopping callback will likely stop training before reaching 100\n",
    "\n",
    "# **How to choose the number:**\n",
    "# - Too few epochs: The model might not learn enough (underfitting)\n",
    "# - Too many epochs: The model might memorize the training data (overfitting)\n",
    "# - The \"right\" number depends on your specific data and model\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Common approaches:**\n",
    "# 1. Set a high number (like 100) but use early stopping to prevent overfitting\n",
    "# 2. Try different values and see which gives the best validation performance\n",
    "# 3. Look at learning curves to see when improvement plateaus\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## What Are Batches?\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Batches** are smaller chunks of your training data processed at one time.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Simple explanation:**\n",
    "# - Instead of studying the entire textbook at once, you study it chapter by chapter\n",
    "# - Each \"chapter\" is a batch of data\n",
    "\n",
    "# In your output, `250/250` means:\n",
    "# - Your training data was divided into 250 batches\n",
    "# - The model has processed all 250 batches (completing one epoch)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## Why Use Batches?\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. **Memory efficiency**: Processing all data at once might not fit in memory\n",
    "# 2. **Training speed**: Updates happen more frequently, potentially speeding up learning\n",
    "# 3. **Better generalization**: Small random variations between batches can help the model generalize better\n",
    "\n",
    "# ## How Batch Size Is Determined\n",
    "\n",
    "# The default batch size in Keras is 32, meaning:\n",
    "# - If you have 8000 training examples, you'd have 8000 Ã· 32 = 250 batches\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can explicitly set the batch size with the `batch_size` parameter:\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "# model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=64, epochs=100, ...)\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Choosing batch size:**\n",
    "# - Smaller batches (8-64): More updates, potentially better generalization, but slower training\n",
    "# - Larger batches (128-512): Faster training, but might generalize less well\n",
    "# - Very large batches: May require more epochs to reach the same performance\n",
    "\n",
    "# The optimal values for both epochs and batch size depend on your specific dataset and model architecture, and often require experimentation to find the best balance.\n",
